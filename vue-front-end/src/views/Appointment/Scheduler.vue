                @event-created="createDragEvent" {
                    whenever an event is created by dragging and dropping on the calendar, call the method createDragEvent

                    this says that whenever an event is clicked, call the openEvent method
                }
                :events="events" {
                    this binds the events to display on the node module calendar to the events listed in this.events on this page.

                    allows us to set our own custom header for the callendar view, instead of using the default config.
